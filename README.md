1. I created 8x8 2D arrray, with all null value. created Tile components and Board components. Then render Tile component with some javascript and prepare board with colors.

2. Then I create peice with their type and color. then Initialized board state with the pieces and render it on the board.

3. Then I learn how to move peices on board, I used onClick, trace moves and update the board state accordingly.
